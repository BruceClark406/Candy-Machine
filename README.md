# Candy-Machine
intelligent candy dispenser 

This is a personal project that I have undertaken. Using a Raspberry Pi Zero, a PIR Sensor, an Ultrasonic Distance Senser, a load cell, 
a round food container, and a small screenI built a candy dispensor that counts, record, and displays the amount of calories coming out 
of the machine.
